First, I would use gcc -g -o labapp labapps.c so that the code will compile with additional information
such as the source code and symbol table needed by the debugger
Next, I would type gdb labapp.c to enter the debugger
Then, I would used the list command to find at which line the generateAttendance function starts
Finally, I would set a breakpoint at the line before using the break command so that the program will stop running once it reaches that line

First, I would use the step command to enter the generateAttendance function
Then, I would once again use list to see where the first node is being accessed
I would set a break point after that line and run the program
Next, I would use the continue command to continue running the program
Finally, I would execute the command print &temp to see the value stored
The address stored was 0x7fffffffd568
